The main modules: (Pay attention to the interfaces)
    viewer: Use xdot,graphviz to show the call tree. (Use function point to act as abstract interface)
    treefy tool(code to call tree)/spider: walks the c files, and get the underlying relations. (use cscope and other things, cscope is weak in variable)

   grader/ analyzer: analyze based on the underlying structure.

    filter: how to do this?? filter what you want to see. Filter what you want to see.
As the viewer just a passive screen? the **presenter** handle the logic
