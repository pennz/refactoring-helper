To compile with MinGW (windows) or gcc (linux, cygwin) just do:

cc -o tceetree tceetree.c gettree.c outgraphviz.c outtree.c slib.c ttree.c

Only the C standard library is needed, so you can adapt this to any other compiler of your choice.

See the REVISION HISTORY within README.txt in the Home folder for a list of all changes and bug fixes.
